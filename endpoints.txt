University Management System â€“ Dockerized Microservices Deployment
 Server IP: http://147.93.105.208/
Each microservice is containerized using Docker and exposed on individual ports. Below is the detailed mapping of all deployed services and their respective endpoints.

Optional (Commented) - API Gateway
# api_gateway:
#   build: ./api_gateway
#   ports:
#     - "7000:8000"
#   depends_on:
#     - user_management
#     - academic_structure
#     - attendance
#     - course_registration
#     - examination_management
#     - university_management

Future Plan: Acts as a central gateway to route requests to respective microservices


Example URL: http://147.93.105.208:7000/ (if enabled)
