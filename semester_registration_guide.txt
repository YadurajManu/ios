SEMESTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
=======================================================
GBU (Gautam Buddha University) College ERP System
Production Implementation with Real APIs

=======================================================
1. OVERVIEW & WORKFLOW
=======================================================

PURPOSE:
Build a fully functional semester registration system that allows students to:
- View predefined courses for their next semester (based on enrolled program)
- Register for the fixed curriculum of their program/course
- Submit registration with fee payment integration
- Track registration status and confirmation

IMPORTANT: Students are already enrolled in a specific program (e.g., B.Tech IT). 
The system automatically determines next semester courses based on their program curriculum.
No course selection - just semester advancement with predefined subjects.
No academic eligibility validation needed.

PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT:
- Server: http://147.93.105.208/
- Course Registration API: Port 6093
- User Management API: Port 6090
- Academic Structure API: Port 6091
- Real PostgreSQL databases with production data

=======================================================
2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & FLOW
=======================================================

REGISTRATION WORKFLOW:
1. Student Login → Authentication Service (Port 6090)
2. Check Current Status → Get student's current semester and program
3. Load Next Semester Curriculum → Get predefined courses for next semester from program structure
4. Display Semester Courses → Show fixed curriculum for student's program
5. Fee Calculation → Calculate registration fees for the semester
6. Payment Integration → Process payment (if required)  
7. Semester Advancement → Increment semester number and register for all courses
8. Registration Submission → Submit semester registration to API
9. Confirmation → Generate registration receipt and update student semester

TECHNICAL FLOW:
iOS App → CourseRegistrationService → Production API (Port 6093) → PostgreSQL Database

=======================================================
3. API ENDPOINTS TO IMPLEMENT
=======================================================

COURSE REGISTRATION SERVICE (Port 6093):
Base URL: http://147.93.105.208:6093/

Endpoints we need to implement:
GET /api/students/{student_id}/current-semester → Get student's current semester
GET /api/programs/{program_id}/semester/{semester_num}/courses → Get predefined courses for specific semester
POST /api/registrations/semester-advance → Submit semester advancement registration
GET /api/students/{student_id}/registrations → Get registration history
PUT /api/students/{student_id}/semester → Update student's current semester after successful registration

ACADEMIC STRUCTURE SERVICE (Port 6091):
GET /api/programs → Get program information
GET /api/departments → Get department structure

USER MANAGEMENT SERVICE (Port 6090):
GET /api/students/{student_id}/profile → Get student academic profile
PUT /api/students/{student_id}/semester → Update current semester

=======================================================

=======================================================
6. GBU-SPECIFIC BUSINESS RULES
=======================================================

ACADEMIC CALENDAR:
- Registration typically opens 2-3 weeks before semester start
- Different registration periods for regular/improvement/supplementary
- Late registration with additional fees

SEMESTER ADVANCEMENT RULES:
- Fixed curriculum per program/semester (no student choice)
- All courses are predefined in program structure
- Credits are automatically assigned based on curriculum
- Student advances to next semester with complete course load
- No academic eligibility validation required

AUTOMATIC COURSE ASSIGNMENT:
- All students can register for next semester (no restrictions)
- Courses are fixed per semester of each program
- Section assignment handled by university administration
- No course selection or prerequisite checking needed
- No capacity limits or academic performance checks

FEES INTEGRATION:
- Registration fees must be paid before confirmation
- Different fee structures for regular/improvement
- Fee waivers for scholarship students

=======================================================
7. USER INTERFACE DESIGN
=======================================================

MAIN REGISTRATION SCREEN:
- Current student info (name, program, current semester)
- Registration period status and deadlines
- Next semester curriculum display (fixed courses)
- Registration status (available/completed)

SEMESTER CURRICULUM DISPLAY:
- Course list with: Code, Name, Credits, Faculty, Schedule
- All courses are predefined (no selection needed)
- Total credits for the semester
- Course descriptions and learning outcomes

SIMPLE REGISTRATION INTERFACE:
- Next semester course list (fixed, no validation needed)
- Semester fee information
- Registration confirmation button
- Registration period status

REGISTRATION SUMMARY:
- Next semester course list (fixed curriculum)
- Total credits for the semester
- Semester fee breakdown and payment options
- Terms and conditions acceptance
- Semester advancement confirmation (e.g., Semester 6 → Semester 7)

=======================================================
8. ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY
=======================================================

API CONNECTION ERRORS:
- Network timeout handling
- Server unavailability fallback
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages

DATA VALIDATION ERRORS:
- Real-time form validation

- Clear error messages with resolution steps
- Prevent invalid submissions

BUSINESS LOGIC ERRORS:
- Prerequisite not met → Show required courses
- Schedule conflict → Highlight conflicting courses
- Course full → Show waitlist option
- Credit limit exceeded → Show current total vs limit

=======================================================
9. TESTING STRATEGY
=======================================================

UNIT TESTING:
- API service methods with mock responses
- Validation logic with various scenarios
- Credit calculation accuracy
